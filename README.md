# HarryPotterAPIrepo

This is a schoolproject were we learn how to use API. 

## The main task

1. Find a fun API
2. Make sure it's open and has "good" documentation, Avoid APIs (in this exercise) that require key
3. Build a page that sends a query to the API and then displays the answer using fetch and DOM manipulation
   -While the response is being loaded from the server, we want to display a "Data loading" type message. Preferably an animated gif.
   -When the response comes from the server, we remove the "loading" message and show the data from the server nicely formatted with html and css

Build something neat and smart!


The API iÂ´m using is: https://hp-api.onrender.com/api/characters
